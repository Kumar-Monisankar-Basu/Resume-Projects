```jsx
<div className="home">
  <div className="home__container">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

1. The outermost `<div>` with the class name "home" serves as a container for the entire home page section. It is used to apply specific styling or layout to the section as a whole.

2. The second `<div>` with the class name "home__container" is a child of the outer `<div>`. It acts as a container for the content within the home page section. It provides a level of organization and styling for the content.

3. The content within the home page section, such as the image and product components, is placed within various nested `<div>` elements inside the "home__container" `<div>`. These nested `<div>` elements are used to structure and position the content in a desired layout, such as rows or columns.

The purpose of having three `<div>` elements with the same class name "home" is to provide a hierarchical structure and apply different levels of styling and organization to the home page section and its content. Each `<div>` element serves a specific purpose within this structure.


```jsx
<div className="home__row">
  {/* Product components */}
</div>

<div className="home__row">
  {/* Product components */}
</div>

<div className="home__row">
  {/* Product components */}
</div>
```

Here, the `<div>` elements with the class name "home__row" are used to group and display multiple `Product` components within separate rows. Each row can contain one or more `Product` components. 

The purpose of having multiple `<div>` elements with the same class name "home__row" is to apply consistent styling and layout to the rows of products. By using the same class name, you can target these elements in CSS or apply common styles to them.

In summary, the multiple `<div>` elements with the class name "home__row" are used to create distinct rows of product components within the home page section.
