1. `import axios from "axios";`:

   - This line imports the `axios` library, which is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests.

2. `const instance = axios.create({ ... });`:

   - The `axios.create()` method is called to create a new instance of the `axios` HTTP client.

   - This allows customization of the client's settings, such as setting a base URL or default headers, which will be applied to each request made with this instance.

3. `baseURL: 'YOUR_URL'`:

   - The `baseURL` property is set to the URL of the API (a cloud function) that will be accessed using this `axios` instance.

   - This URL represents the root URL for all subsequent requests made through this instance.

4. `export default instance;`:

   - The created `axios` instance is exported as the default export of the module.
   
   - By using `export default`, other modules can import this instance using the default import syntax, like this: `import instance from './axiosInstance';`.

In summary, this code sets up an instance of the `axios` HTTP client with a specific base URL. This instance can be used to make HTTP requests to the specified API endpoint. By exporting it as the default export, other modules can easily import and use this pre-configured `axios` instance to interact with the specified API.
